# AutoZoom

## It is a piece of code that will automatically zoom the entire website to the width of your choice, no matter how much the user tries to zoom out

### you think that your website looks great up to a certain amount of width but after that with the increase of width, it blows off! So just replace the "constant_width" to your desired width and then above that width, it can't be zoomed out any further...

## This Piece of code is the of my "Useful Code"...
